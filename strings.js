	aboutBody: "Hi, I'm Rafael Morais, and I have the privilege of working with what I love: technology and game development. I began my journey in game development at the age of 15, and since then, I've been deeply passionate about programming and creating interactive digital experiences. I enjoy solving complex problems and dedicating time to designing smart, reusable solutions that can benefit a wide range of projects. I take particular satisfaction in developing tools and features that enhance the productivity and creativity of others. Whether it's implementing gameplay mechanics, optimizing systems, or creating custom workflows, I'm always looking for ways to contribute meaningfully to a team or community. Outside of work, I also have a strong interest in systems architecture and engine development — in fact, one of my main hobbies is building custom game engines from scratch. This hobby allows me to explore lower-level programming concepts and better understand how high-performance systems are structured. I'm constantly learning and seeking new challenges, always aiming to improve both my technical skills and my ability to collaborate effectively.",
