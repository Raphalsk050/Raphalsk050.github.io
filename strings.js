	aboutBody: "I'm Rafael Morais, a software engineer who has the privilege of working with what I love: technology and game development. I started my journey in game development at 15, and since then I've been deeply focused on C++ programming, engine architecture, and building interactive digital experiences.\n\nI enjoy tackling complex systems-level problems — designing performant, maintainable architectures and crafting smart, reusable solutions that scale across large codebases. I take particular satisfaction in developing engine systems, tools, and features that enhance the productivity and creativity of development teams.\n\nWhether it's implementing core engine systems, optimizing performance-critical code paths, or creating custom development workflows, I'm always looking for ways to push both the technical quality and efficiency of the projects I work on.\n\nOutside of work, one of my main hobbies is building custom game engines from scratch in C++. This allows me to explore lower-level programming concepts — memory management, rendering pipelines, multithreaded systems — and better understand how high-performance engines are structured at their core.\n\nI'm constantly learning, seeking new challenges, and aiming to improve both my technical depth and my ability to collaborate effectively within engineering teams.",
